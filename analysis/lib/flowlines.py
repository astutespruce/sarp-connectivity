    According to the NHDPlus HR guide (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1096/ofr20191096.pdf),
    stream order should not go down after divergences.  However, we found that
    the first flowline after a divergence retains the same stream order as before
    the divergence (correct), the flowline immediately downstream of that where
    there is an incoming tributary is assigned the stream order of that tributary
    instead, which can be substantially lower than the stream order prior to
    divergence (incorrect).

    This traces the network from each instance where it happens and attempts to
